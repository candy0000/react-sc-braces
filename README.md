For vanilla HTML + CSS, check out the [Codepen](https://codepen.io/karlhorky/pen/vwmqqv).

## Install

This component is intended for use with React and styled-components. If you're using those libraries already, just copy and paste the component file [`Brace.js`](./Brace.js) into your codebase. This hasn't been published as a package yet, because publishing CSS packages is not great with the current state of tooling in 2019.
